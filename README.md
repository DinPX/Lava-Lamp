# Lava Lamp
Simple lava lamp to spice up your desktop

> [!NOTE]
> Since its window is borderless and I haven't implemented a popup UI for minimizing, scaling, and closing the window, there's no way to do the aforementioned yet. Just close the window thru tabs, Windows Task Manager, or other methods.
